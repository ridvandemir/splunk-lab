# splunk-lab
Forwarding data Splunk in different ways

Objective
The Splunk Lab project aimed to establish a comprehensive environment for exploring Splunkâ€™s data ingestion and analysis capabilities. The primary focus was on configuring Splunk components (Search Head, Indexer, and Universal Forwarders) to forward logs from Linux and Windows machines. The lab was designed to explore Splunk's diverse data input mechanisms, including forwarding logs, running scripts to collect data, sending data via HTTP, and configuring Firewall inputs for real-time log ingestion.

Skills Learned

- Proficiency in configuring and managing Splunk components (Search Head, Indexer, and Universal Forwarder).
- Practical experience in forwarding logs from Linux and Windows systems.
- Understanding of various Splunk input possibilities, such as scripted inputs, HTTP Event Collector, and Firewall inputs.
- Hands-on knowledge of setting up and configuring Splunk infrastructure for effective data collection and analysis.
- Enhanced ability to troubleshoot and optimize log ingestion workflows in Splunk.

Tools Used

- Virtual Machine to deploy lab environment
- Splunk Enterprise for log management, analysis, and querying.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder for log forwarding from Windows and Linux machines.
